/**
 * Scoring for retrospective Seed Comparisons.
 *
 * Live evidence is scored on the probability Brier score. Seed evidence cannot
 * be: public archives publish an amount but no probability. Rather than invent a
 * probability, seed evidence is scored on the amount-and-outcome skill that
 * `precipSkill.ts` already defines and unit-tests — rain/no-rain with
 * an asymmetric miss penalty, plus an amount term on days it actually rained.
 *
 * Two rules keep the seed from overstating itself:
 *
 * 1. Capped influence. Seed weights are blended toward equal at SEED_INFLUENCE,
 *    never applied at full strength, because they rest on model proxies rather
 *    than on the providers' own published forecasts.
 * 2. No opinion is not a penalty. A provider absent from the seed (or not yet
 *    mature in it) is scored at the neutral mean, so it lands near equal instead
 *    of being demoted for having no archive proxy.
