 * Pure bucketing for the Forecast section's glanceable time-of-day strip. The
 * hourly series (already "now"-anchored — entries[0] is the current hour) is
 * folded into up to eight consecutive 3-hour windows — entries [0–2], [3–5],
 * … [21–23] — so the next ~24 hours read as eight wide blocks instead of a
 * 24-column scroll. Eight is what the providers actually reach: they cap the
 * series at 24 entries, so this consumes the series rather than truncating it.
 *
 * Everything here is Asia/Seoul and honours the "never fabricate" rule: a block
 * is built only when the data supports it (short series → fewer blocks, never an
 * invented one) and `precipMax` is `null` — not `0` — when no hour in the block
 * carries a probability.
